This is my thoughts on the project.

I mainly had trouble with making the correct path to images and link on my pages. I thought for my index links odin-recipes/recipes/file-name.html would work because Im going out of my file back to my root folder through the subsequent paths to the page. But I guess I am already on the root folder so I only need to go in recipes/ to the desired file. 

I also had trouble with sourcing images. I thought i just needed to make a pathway and the web would know where to go next. For example, with v-lasagna.html, I thought i just needed odin-recipes/img/img.jpg but that doesnt make sense looking back. My current page(v-lasagna.html) is cant jump to odin-recipes folder. So I was a bit stuck and needed to look back on the image lesson. I wouldnt expect ../ to send me back to the parent folder. I thought terminal commands are only used on the terminal.

Other than those I didnt have any problems.
