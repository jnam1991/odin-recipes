        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <h4>Main Ingredients</h4>

        <ul>

            <li>15 ounce full fat coconut milk can</li>
            <li>2 cups plant-based milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons organic sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vinilla extract</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Optional Ingredients</h4>

        <ul>

            <li>about 1/2 cup of spiced rum</li>
            <li>cinnamon sticks for garnish</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>

            <li>Shake the can of coconut milk vigorously to minimize chunks. Combine the coconut milk along with the rest of the Main Eggnog Ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, whisking frequently, until the spices mostly dissolve and the nog is totally smooth and heated through, for about 10-15 minutes. <strong>Dont let the mixture boil</strong>, because you dont want a skin to form on top.</li>
            <li>Divide your rum(if you're using it) between four to six mugs. Either way, top off your mug with eggnog from the pan. Garnish with a cinnamon stick if you want.</li>

        </ol>
