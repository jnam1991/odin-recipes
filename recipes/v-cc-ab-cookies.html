        <p>All almond butter, no butter. Take a cookie break with these chocolatey, and nutty delectables. You deserve it!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            
            <li>1 1/2 cups flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2/3 cup almond butter</li>
            <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ground flaxseed</li>
            <li>3/4 cup plant-based milk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vinalla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 to 2/3 cup chocolate chips</li>
            
        </ul>

        <ol>

            <li>In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt</li>
            <li>In the large bowl, mix together the almond butter and sugars until it looks kinda creamy and fluffy. Slowly add in the ground flaxseed, milk, and vanilla extract until a loose batter forms in there.</li>
            <li>When all of that is mixed up, add the sifted flour stuff slowly into the bowl. Mix that up until there are no more dry spots. Fold in the chocolate chips, cover, and put the batter in the fridge for at least 1 hour and for up to 2 days</li>
            <li>When you are ready for some cookies, heat your oven to 350&deg;F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </li>
            <li>Scoop out a spoonful of dough onto the sheet and kind of flatten it out a bit until you get about a 2-inch-wide cookie. After all the batter is used, bake until the bottoms are nice and golden, 15-18 minutes. Take them off the sheet and let them cool on a wire rack for at least 10 minutes before serving.</li>

        </ol>
